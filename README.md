# Car-Price-Prediction
The dataset contains the details of the old cars and new ones. Hence we have to use various Machine learning models to Predict the price of the car. I have used the Randomized search CV for hyperparameter tuning to find the best parameters and feature selection to find the best features Importance.

# Machine Learning Algorithms
1. Random Forest Regressor
2. XG Boost Regressor
3. CatBoost Regressor
4. LGBM Regressor
